In case of Login successful API: 

- If correct HTTP status code (Can be : 200 OK, as all entries correct)
- If correct response payload has been returned 
- If reposnse data is structured correctly (JSON/XML/HTML format)
- Does it triggers some other API/event (Can be checked if not correct response has returned)
- If response time is in limit 
- Verify basic performance test : If an operation was completed successfully but took an unreasonable amount of time, the test can be marked as failed
- Any interruption happens? (interrupt listeners could be tracked)

- (Negative test) : If another email address/user is entered with no such existing entry of user, does it show correct HTTP status code and response? (Can show 400 Bad request- User does not found)
- (Negative test) : If for same email address/user, wrong password is entered, does it show correct HTTP status code and response? (Can show 400 Bad request- Password is invalid)
- (Negative test) : Blank email address/password 
- (Negative test) : If missing any key/value
- (Negative test) : Missing both fields
